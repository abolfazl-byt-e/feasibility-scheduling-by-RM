# feasibility-scheduling-by-RM
feasibility scheduling by Rate Monotonic Algorithm</ br>
1- input tasks with (start - period - execution time - relative deadline)</ br>
2- return utilizatin of cpu with this tasks and maximum utilization of RM algorithm with n tasks</ br>
3- maximum response time of every task if they can be scheduled</ br>
4- feasibility (yes - no)</ br>
</ br></ br></ br></ br>
NOTE: if utilization of cpu be smaller than utilization of rm algorithm with n task  and the program gives the output "NO", because the program considers the worst case in terms of critical instanse, so there is a small possibility that the tasks can be programmed in a certain state, but the RM algorithm does not guarantee.
